#Star Wars Destiny Trader

This is a person project that I am working on to help push my understanding of the MERN stack.

##MVP

This app will allow users to create wish and trade lists for Fantasy Flight's new CCG Star Wars Destiny. The users will be able to register, login, create lists for their collection, view other's trade lists, message and offer exchanges and trades for their cards. Though final trading will ultimately be handled outside of the app, users can then provide positive ratings to traders after a successful trade. Geolocation will help provide other useful information when considering to entertain offers from users.
